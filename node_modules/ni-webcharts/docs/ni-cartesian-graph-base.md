## Webcharts API methods
The following methods are available for ni-cartesian-graph, ni-chart and
ni-intensity-graph.

**setData** is the prefered method to write data to a graph. The other
option, writing to the *value* property of the element is only recommended
for rarely changed small datasets, since it consumes more memory and CPU
due to the serialization/deserialization needed.

```js
// graph needs to be ready before calling any methods on it
var graph = document.querySelector('#myGraph');
graph.setData([1, 2, 3, 4, 5]);
```

**onRecenterPlot** is used to perform a reset for webcharts. This includes
resetting the offset of the axis and redrawing of the plot.

```js
// graph needs to be ready before calling any methods on it
var graph = document.querySelector('#myGraph');
graph.onRecenterPlot();
```
