## ni-cartesian-plot-renderer

> Describes the way a plot is rendered

The four ways to render a plot are the line renderer, the area fill renderer,
the points renderer and the bar renderer. You can combine these in any way you
like for a single plot and different plots can have different renderers.

The fastest one is the line renderer and this is the recomended one for large
data sets and if you care about performance.

The render can be further customized by using the renderer properties.


### ni-cartesian-plot-renderer properties

       will be automatically assigned to the plot.
