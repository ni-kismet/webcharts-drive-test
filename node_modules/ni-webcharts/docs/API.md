## Introduction ##

Webcharts is a collection of [web components](https://www.webcomponents.org/introduction)
for plotting engineering and scientific data, with a focus on performance.

## Using webcharts ##

Webcharts is distributed through npm with the package name **ni-webcharts**.

Add webcharts to your app:

    npm install --save ni-webcharts

Add webcharts to a webpage:

```html
<link rel="stylesheet" href="node_modules/ni-webcharts/styles/webchartsLight.css" />
<link rel="import" href="node_modules/ni-webcharts/dist/webcharts.min.html"/>
<script type="text/javascript" src="node_modules/webcomponents-lite/webcomponents-lite.js"></script>
```

## Styling webcharts ##

The way Webcharts look is configured using a mix of elements properties, described
below in this document, and CSS styles. A guide for styling with CSS is [here](styling.md).



## ni-cartesian-graph

> A custom element that allows to graph one or multiple data sets.

An ni-cartesian-graph is a declarative way, that uses custom elements, to add a graph
to a web page. Specify your data sets using the value attribute and customize how
the data is renderended using nested custom elements such as *ni-cartesian-axis*,
*ni-cartesian-plot*, *ni-cartesian-plot-renderer* or *ni-cursor*.

Example showing how you can render a graph of prime number versus fibonacci numbers.
```html
<ni-cartesian-graph value="[[2, 3, 5, 7, 11, 13, 17, 19],
                          [0, 1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13]]">
  <ni-cartesian-axis show label="Index" axis-position="bottom"></ni-cartesian-axis>
  <ni-cartesian-axis show label="Value" axis-position="left"></ni-cartesian-axis>
  <ni-cartesian-plot show label="Prime Numbers">
    <ni-cartesian-plot-renderer line-width="2" line-stroke="red">
    </ni-cartesian-plot-renderer>
  </ni-cartesian-plot>
  <ni-cartesian-plot show label="Fibonacci Numbers">
    <ni-cartesian-plot-renderer line-width="2" line-stroke="blue">
    </ni-cartesian-plot-renderer>
  </ni-cartesian-plot>
</ni-cartesian-graph>
```


### ni-cartesian-graph properties

**graph-ref** - a graph id used to bind legends to the graph

**plot-area-margin** - TODO - document this


### ni-cartesian-graph methods

**setData** is the prefered method to write data to a graph. The other
option, writing to the *value* property of the element is only recomended
for rarely changed small datasets, since it consumes more memory and CPU
due to the serialization/deserialization needed.

```js
// graph needs to be ready before calling any methods on it
var graph = document.querySelector('#myGraph');
graph.setData([1, 2, 3, 4, 5]);
```


## Data types supported by the ni-cartesian-graph

Data can be passed to a graph either through writing to the element value
property or using API access (the setData() method on the element).

Here is a list of supported data types:


* **A 1D array of numerics**
```js
[a1, a2, a3]
```
Will be drawn as a single plot. It's an efficient and fast way to
pass data to the graph.

A typed array view is also allowed.


* **A 2D array of numerics**
```js
[[a1, a2, a3], [b1, b2, b3]]
```
Will be drawn as multiple plots. It's an efficient and fast way to
pass data to the graph.

An array of typed array views is also allowed.


* **An analogWaveform**
```js
var data = new NIAnalogWaveform({
    t0: new NITimestamp(),
    dt: 0.001, // 1 ms
    Y: [a1, a2, a3]
});
```
Will be drawn as a single plot. It's an
efficient and fast way to pass data to the graph


* **An array of analogWaveforms**
```js
var aw0 = new NIAnalogWaveform({
    t0: new NITimestamp(),
    dt: 0.001, // 1 ms
    Y: [a1, a2, a3]
});
var aw1 = new NIAnalogWaveform({
    t0: new NITimestamp(),
    dt: 0.001, // 1 ms
    Y: [b1, b2, b3]
});
var data = [aw0, aw1];
```
Will be drawn as multiple plots. It's an efficient and fast way to
pass data to the graph.


* **An object (cluster) of arrays**
```js
var data = {a: [a1, a2, a3], b: [b1, b2, b3]};
```
 Will be drawn as a single XY plot,
the first array will hold the X coordinates and the second the Y
coordinates. This format is only recomended when you want to display
XY data, it's not particulary efficient or fast.


* **An array of objects (clusters) of arrays**
```js
var data = [
    {a: [a1, a2, a3], b: [b1, b2, b3]},
    {c: [c1, c2, c3], d: [d1, d2, d3]}
];
```
Will be drawn as multiple XY plots, the first array in the object
(cluster) will hold the X coordinates and the second the Y coordinates.
This format is only recomended when you want to display XY data,
it's not particulary efficient or fast.


* **An array of objects (clusters)**
```js
var data = [
    {x: a1, y: b1},
    {x: a2, y: b2},
    {x: a3, y: b3},
];
```
Will be drawn as a single XY plot, the first element in the cluster
will hold the X coordinates and the second the Y coordinates. This
format is only recomended when you want to display XY data, it's not
particulary efficient or fast.


* **An array of array of objects (clusters)**
```js
var data = [
    [{x: a1, y: b1}, {x: a2, y: b2}, {x: a3, y: b3}],
    [{x: c1, y: d1}, {x: c2, y: d2}, {x: c3, y: d3}]
];
```
Will be drawn as multiple XY plots, the first element in the cluster
will hold the X coordinates and the second the Y coordinates. This
format is only recomended when you want to display XY data, it's not
particulary efficient or fast.


* **An 1D array of Complex Numbers**
```js
var a1 = new NIComplex(1, 2);
var a2 = new NIComplex(2, 3);
var a3 = new NIComplex(3, 4);
var data = [a1, a2, a3]; // array of complex numbers
var data2 = ['1+2i', '2+3i', '3+4i']; // also accepted as input
```
Will be drawn as a single plot.


* **A 2D array of Complex Numbers**
```js
var a1 = new NIComplex(1, 2);
var a2 = new NIComplex(2, 3);
var b1 = new NIComplex(3, 4);
var b2 = new NIComplex(4, 5);
var data = [[a1, a2], [b1, b2]]; // arrays of complex numbers
var data2 = [['1+2i', '2+3i'], ['3+4i', '4+5i']]; // also accepted as input
```
Will be drawn as multiple plots.




## ni-chart

> A custom element that allows to chart one or multiple data sets.

The difference between a graph and a chart is that a graph plots directly the data
sets provided but the chart uses a buffer of historical values, called a
HistoryBuffer for data handling.

As you append new values to the charts' History buffer the chart is updated as
needed, on the next browser animation frame.

Example:

```html
<ni-chart id="chart1" bufferSize="1024">
    <ni-cartesian-axis show label="Time" axis-position="bottom"></ni-cartesian-axis>
    <ni-cartesian-axis show label="Amplitude" axis-position="left"></ni-cartesian-axis>
    <ni-cartesian-plot show label="Plot 1">
      <ni-cartesian-plot-renderer line-width="2" line-stroke="#a84716"></ni-cartesian-plot-renderer>
    </ni-cartesian-plot>
</ni-chart>

<script>
  var historyBuffer = $('#chart1').getHistoryBuffer();

  // write 1000 values into the chart's history buffer
  for (var i = 0; i < 10; i++) {
    historyBuffer.push(Math.sin(i));
    i += 0.01;
  }
</script>
```

The HistoryBuffer API is described [here](historyBuffer.md).

## Data types supported by ni-chart

To add data to the chart you need to write it into the history buffer. Here are
examples for adding numbers and arrays of numbers to the history buffer.

* **Numbers**
```js
    var chart = document.querySelector('#myChart');
    var hb = chart.getHistoryBuffer();

    hb.push(5); // add 5 to the history buffer
```
This will render a single plot

* **multiple Numbers**
```js
    var chart = document.querySelector('#myChart');
    var hb = chart.getHistoryBuffer();

    hb.push([5, 7, 8]); // adds 5 to first data series,
                        // 7 to the second one and 8 to the third one
```
This will render 3 plots

* **array of Numbers**
```js
    var chart = document.querySelector('#myChart');
    var hb = chart.getHistoryBuffer();

    hb.appendArray([5, 7, 8]); // add 5, 7 and 8 to first data series
```
This will render a single plot.

* **arrays of arrays of Numbers**
```js
    var chart = document.querySelector('#myChart');
    var hb = chart.getHistoryBuffer();

    hb.appendArray([[5, 7], [8, 9]]); // add 5 and 7 to first data series
                                     // and 8 and 9 to the second one
```
This will render two plots.


When writing values to multiple plots make sure the history buffer is the same
size as the number of data series you write to. Use [history buffer's](historyBuffer.md) *setWidth*
method to change the number of data series in the chart.


### ni-chart properties

**buffer-size** (number) - the size of the chart history buffer 

### ni-chart methods

**setHistoryBuffer(historyBuffer)** - changes the internal history buffer
   of the chart to the provided one

**getHistoryBuffer()** - returns a reference to the internal history
   buffer of the chart


## ni-intensity-graph

> A custom element that allows to plot a 2D data set as a gradient map.

An ni-intensity-graph is a declarative way, that uses custom elements, to add an
intensity graph to a web page. Specify your data sets using the value attribute
and customize how the data is renderended using nested custom elements such as
*ni-cartesian-axis*, *ni-color-scale*.

Example:
```html
<ni-intensity-graph id="graph1" value="[[0.1, 0.2], [0.3, 0.4], [0.5, 0.6]]">
    <ni-cartesian-axis label="X" show show-label axis-position="bottom" grid-lines></ni-cartesian-axis>
    <ni-cartesian-axis label="Y" show show-label axis-position="left" grid-lines></ni-cartesian-axis>
    <ni-color-scale label="Color Scale" show show-label
        markers='[{"value":0,"color":"rgba(0,0,0,1)"},{"value":50,"color":"rgba(0,0,255,1)"},{"value":100,"color":"rgba(255,255,255,1)"}]'
        high-color="rgba(255,255,255,1)" low-color="rgba(0,0,0,1)">
    </ni-color-scale>
</ni-intensity-graph>
```



## ni-cartesian-axis

> Add axes to a graph.

```html
<ni-cartesian-graph>
  <ni-cartesian-axis show grid-lines show-label label="Axis 1" axis-position='bottom'>
  </ni-cartesian-axis>
  <ni-cartesian-axis show grid-lines show-label label="Axis 2" axis-position='top'>
  </ni-cartesian-axis>
  <ni-cartesian-axis show grid-lines show-label label="Axis 3" axis-position='left'>
  </ni-cartesian-axis>
</ni-cartesian-graph>
```
Multiple vertical and horizontal axes can be added to a graph and configured.

Axes can be placed to the right, left and on top or bottom of a graph, can use a
logarithmic scale if desired and can show time. A relative time format is supported
along with the absolute time format.

The minimum and maximum value of an axis can be specified. Autoscaling according
to the data ranges dispayed is also possible.


### ni-cartesian-axis properties

**axis-ref** - an axis id used to bind plots to the axes. Default: ''

**show** (boolean) - if true the axis will be visible. Default: false

**label** (string) - the name of the axis. Default: '' 

**axis-position** (string) - the position of the axis. Default: 'left'
 Accepted values: 'top', 'bottom', 'left' and 'right'


**show-label** (boolean) - if true the axis label will be visible.
       Default: false 

**minimum** (number) - the minimum axis value. Default: 0

**maximum** (number) - the maximum axis value. Default: 1

**auto-scale** (string) - if 'exact' or 'loose' the axis will adapt to the data
       ranges of the plots assigned to that axis. if 'none', the axis will adapt to the 
       minimum and maximum options. Default: 'auto'

**log-scale** (boolean) - if true the axis will be a log axis. Default: false

**format** (string) - the format of the tick labels. Default: ''
TODO: document the format


**show-tick-labels** (string) - which of the tick labels are visible.
       Possible values: 'none', 'endpoints', 'major' and 'all'. Default: 'all'.
       For 'endpoints' only the minimum and the maximum values will be visible
       at the edges of the axis. To make some intermediary values visible use
       'major', and 'all' to show all of them.

**grid-lines** (boolean) - if true the grid lines for the axis will
       be visible. Default: false

**show-ticks** (boolean) - if true the tick lines for the axis will
       be visible. A tick line is a short line which connects the tick label with
       the axis. Default: false

**show-minor-ticks** (boolean) - if true the minor tick lines for the axis
       will be visible. Minor tick lines are short lines (half of the tick line
       length) which subdivide the interval between tick lines in five intervals.
       Default: false


## ni-color-scale

> A color scale added to an intensity graph is used to configure the color
gradients.

```html
<ni-intensity-graph>
  <ni-cartesian-axis ...></ni-cartesian-axis>
  <ni-cartesian-axis ...></ni-cartesian-axis>
  <ni-color-scale show show-label label="Color Scale" low-color="blue" high-color="red">
  </ni-color-scale>
</ni-intensity-graph>
```

A single color scale can be added to an intensity graph to visualize and control
the maping from values to the color gradient displayed.

Color scales are only supported by intensity graphs, when added to other types of
webcharts they do nothing.

The color gradients are described by an array of stops, for example this:

```js
[
{"value":0,"color":"rgba(0,0,0,1)"},
{"value":0.5,"color":"rgba(0,0,255,1)"},
{"value":1,"color":"rgba(255,255,255,1)"}
]
```

describes a color gradient going from black at the stop with the value 0, to
blue at the stop with the value 0.5 and then to white at the stop with the value
1.


### ni-color-scale properties

**label** (string) - the name of the color scale. Default: '' 

**show** (boolean) - if true the color scale will be visible. Default: false

**markers** (string) - the color gradient used to map values to colorScaleAxis. Default: ''.
       TODO: document the gradient format, better default value

**auto-scale** (string) - if 'exact' the color gradient will strech to adapt to the
       range of the data set provided. Default: 'auto'

**minimum** (number) - the minimum axis value. Default: 0

**maximum** (number) - the maximum axis value. Default: 1


## ni-cartesian-plot

> A custom element that, along with a nested ni-cartesian-plot-renderer describes
the way a data plot is rendered.

A plot is the graphic representation of a data set. A graph or chart can show
simultaneously multiple data sets (plots). To customize how a data set, or plot
is rendered use ni-cartesian-plot elements nested inside a graph or chart
element.

```html
<ni-cartesian-graph>
  <ni-cartesian-axis axis-ref="axis1ref" show axis-position="bottom"></ni-cartesian-axis>
  <ni-cartesian-axis axis-ref="axis2ref" show axis-position="left"></ni-cartesian-axis>
  <ni-cartesian-plot show label="plot 1" xaxis="axis1ref" yaxis="axis2ref">
    add an ni-cartesian-plot-renderer here
  </ni-cartesian-plot>
</ni-cartesian-graph>
```


### ni-cartesian-plot properties 

**show** (boolean) - if true the plot will be shown. Default: false 

**label** (string) - the name of the plot. Default: '' 

**xaxis** (string) - the X axis that this plot will use. Default: ''.
       Accepted values: an axis-ref. In case an xaxis with the specified axis-ref
       is not found the first xaxis is used

**yaxis** (string) - the Y axis that this plot will use. Default: ''.
       Accepted values: an axis-ref. In case an yaxis with the specified axis-ref
       is not found the first yaxis is used

**enable-hover** (boolean) - if true, when the mouse hovers close to a point on the plot
       a tooltip with the point value will be shown 

**hover-format** (string) - specifies the format of the text shown in the tooltip. TODO: document the format


## ni-cartesian-plot-renderer

> Describes the way a plot is rendered

The four ways to render a plot are the line renderer, the area fill renderer,
the points renderer and the bar renderer. You can combine these in any way you
like for a single plot and different plots can have different renderers.

The fastest one is the line renderer and this is the recomended one for large
data sets and if you care about performance.

The render can be further customized by using the renderer properties.


### ni-cartesian-plot-renderer properties 

**line-stroke** (string) - the color of the line drawn. Default: 'auto'.
       Accepted values: a CSS color string, an empty string or 'auto'. If an empty string
       is passed the line rendering for the plot is disabled. If 'auto' is passed a color
       will be automatically assigned to the plot.
       

**line-width** (number) - the width of the line. Use 1 for maximum
       performance as thicker lines can be slower, depending on the browser and
       the graphic card used. Default: 1

**line-style** (string) - the style of the line drawn. Default: 'solid'.
       Accepted values: *'solid'*, *'dot'*, *'mediumdash'*, *'dashdot'* and *'largedash'*
       

**area-fill** (string) - the color of the area fill drawn under/over
       the line. Default: ''.
       Accepted values: a CSS color string, an empty string or auto. If an empty string
       is passed the area fill for the plot is disabled. If 'auto' is passed a color
       will be automatically assigned to the fill.
       

**area-base-line** (string) - determines the direction the area fill.
Default: 'zero'. Accepted values:

* 'zero': fill the line towards 0
* '-infinity': fill the line towards -Infinity.
* 'infinity': fill the line towards Infinity.


**bar-fill** (string) - the color of the bars drawn. Default: ''.
       Accepted values: a CSS color string, an empty string or auto. If an empty
       string is passed the bars rendering for the plot is disabled. If 'auto'
       is passed a color will be automatically assigned to the bars.
       

**point-color** (string) - the color of the points drawn. Default: ''.
       Accepted values: a CSS color string, an empty string or auto. If an empty
       string is passed the points rendering for the plot is disabled. If 'auto'
       is passed a color will be automatically assigned to the points.
       

**point-size** (number) - the size of the points drawn. Default: 5.

**point-shape** (string) - determines the shape of the points.
       Default: 'ellipse'. Accepted values: 'ellipse', 'square', 'diamond',
       'triangle', 'cross'
       


## ni-cursor

> Add cursors to a graph.

Sometimes you want to take a measurement off a graph you have made. Cursors allow
you to do that.

```html
<ni-cartesian-graph>
  <ni-cartesian-axis show grid-lines show-label label="Axis 1" axis-position='bottom'>
  </ni-cartesian-axis>
  <ni-cartesian-axis show grid-lines show-label label="Axis 2" axis-position='top'>
  </ni-cartesian-axis>
  <ni-cursor label="Cursor 1" show show-label snap-to-data cursor-color="#40d387"></ni-cursor>
</ni-cartesian-graph>
```
Multiple cursors can be added to a graph and configured.


### ni-cursor properties
