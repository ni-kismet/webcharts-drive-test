        <h1>Webcharts: Doctor Who theme (1963)</h1>

        <p> The original 1963 recording of the Doctor Who theme music is widely
            regarded as a significant and innovative piece of electronic music,
            recorded well before the availability of commercial synthesisers.
        </p>
        <p> Delia Derbyshire (assisted by Dick Mills) of the BBC Radiophonic Workshop
            used musique concr√®te techniques to realise a score written by composer Ron Grainer.
        </p>

        <p>
            Each note was individually created by cutting, splicing, speeding up
            and slowing down segments of analogue tape containing recordings of a
            single plucked string, white noise, and the simple harmonic waveforms
            of test-tone oscillators which were used for calibrating equipment and
            rooms, not creating music.
        </p>
        <p>
            The main, pulsing bassline rhythm was created
            from a recording of a single plucked string, played over and over again
            in different patterns created by splicing copies of the sound, with
            different pitches and notes achieved by playing the sample in different speeds.
